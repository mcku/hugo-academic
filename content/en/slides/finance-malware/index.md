## What is APT?

Long-term attacks by various cyber attackers and APT groups infiltrating critical telecom infrastructures and financial systems to cause significant damage.

#### Example of APT: FastCash (Hidden Cobra)

Unauthorized cash withdrawals from ATMs through ISO 8583 protocol.

Developed by a group originating from East Asia.

Detected in 2018.

Believed to have been active since 2016.

Infects ATM switch as malware.

Approves incoming requests without authorization.

---

#### Example of APT: FastCash (Hidden Cobra)

Since 2018, it has started being detected by antivirus software.

Symantec bulletin: https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/fastcash-lazarus-atm-malware

---

_As of 15th October 2024, a new Linux variant of the FASTCash malware was discovered._

- North Korean threat actors
- Targets banking systems
- Steals interbank payment keys

_Known methods and issues_

_From a cybersecurity perspective_

- Isolating the ATM network is not enough. Advanced cyberattacks can bypass this isolation.
- Cybersecurity products can only detect malware they can identify.
- Detection of FastCash took 2 years.

Known malware can be detected this way, but what about the unknown ones?
There may be numerous threats not yet detected while APTs are active in the field.

#### Conventional Approach 1 - Cybersecurity

<span style="color:orange;">Fighting malware with cybersecurity products</span>

🚫 Relying on the manufacturer to prepare a malware signature.

🚫 Even if a signature is available, new variants of malware can emerge quickly.

🚫 Defining these signatures for multiple products is exhausting.

🚫 Cybersecurity products have limited support for financial protocols.

{{% speaker_note %}}

_Why cybersecurity products don't suffice_

- These products are focused on cybersecurity, requiring significant effort to monitor financial transaction status.
- The goal of cybersecurity is to counter known threats from internal and external networks.
- It's not within the scope of cybersecurity to draw conclusions from movements in ISO 8583, ATM, and mobile protocols.

#### Conventional Approach 2 - Log Analysis

<span style="color:orange;">Collecting logs and trying to catch anomalies through analysis</span>

🚫 Looking at network traffic and trying to relate logs from as many servers as possible to see the big picture.

🚫 Since malware exploits system vulnerabilities, it may not always generate logs.

❔🚫 Network traffic analysis is essential, but it can't detect malware operating locally.

🚫 Collecting logs from both financial application servers and cybersecurity systems:

🌋 Performance loss and delays in log transfer may occur.

{{% speaker_note %}}

_Why log analysis doesn't suffice_

- Collecting detailed status information from application servers.
- Aggregating this information in a central log server.
- Evaluating and generating alarms is required.
- It's challenging to define blocking rules across multiple network devices at different layers.
- Due to encrypted network information, using this information directly is not possible.
- Catching anomalies solely through traffic analysis is very difficult.

#### Conventional Approach 3 - Using Financial Fraud Engine

Attempting to detect malware during online transactions by integrating with financial applications’ messaging.

🚫 It's impossible to detect malware using the limited information conveyed by the financial system.

🚫 Integrating the fraud component with other cybersecurity components is highly challenging.

---

#### Conventional Approach 3 - Using Financial Fraud Engine (ATM)

🌋 While it is possible to monitor message traffic from the ATM network in real time, matching ATM messages with approval messages from servers is required.

🌋 If the ATM dispenses cash without such an approval, an alarm should be generated.

🌋 To do this with traditional methods, logging must be enabled on all servers. This leads to slowdowns and log increases.

The conventional approach will struggle significantly.

🤔 Alternative?

### Proposal: A different perspective

<span style="color:green;"> Airport 360-degree passenger security analogy </span>

- Controls are in place at each step in an airport: parking lot, entrance gate, ticketing, security gate, passport control, and boarding.
- Skipping any step or detail should not be possible.
- A system is established to monitor and match each stage.
- All steps are recorded and controlled.

#### 360-Degree Approach

<span style="color:green;">360-degree perspective applied:</span>

✅ Monitoring all components simultaneously in real-time without performance loss.

✅ Scenario sets prepared by looking at the big picture.

🌠 Bonus: Detection of anomalies in all flows using machine learning and AI algorithms.

✅ Analyzing financial protocols and catching anomalies at the financial layer.

✅ Collecting data without performance loss.

#### 360-Degree Financial System Protection - 1

- Tracking activities in POS, ATM, internet, mobile, switch, authorization, and integration protocols.
- Monitoring and control at every stage.
- Manual scenario and rule sets can be defined.
- Machine learning and AI engine are used.
- Data collection requires no integration, taken directly from the network infrastructure.

---

#### 360-Degree Financial System Protection - 2

- Records are collected by decrypting the data passing through the wire.
- No additional load on servers and systems during collection, hence network performance remains unaffected.
- Technically, the port mirroring feature of network devices is utilized. Traffic from each stage is mirrored to the analysis server.

- Captured transactions are either flagged for monitoring or blocked with the FINANCIAL TRANSACTION GATEWAY.

### Conclusion

With a single solution, monitoring the financial network end-to-end and conducting compliance checks for each transaction based on rule-based and AI-based controls.

Thus, protecting against threats like unauthorized cash withdrawals from ATMs by undetected malware.
