## Challenges of BTRANS reporting

The requirement to submit BTRANS reports daily has created a need for automating the reporting process. The routine for manually retrieving reports from the database or report services, uploading them to institutional servers, and verifying them is clearly defined.

With the BTRANS automation solution, the reports for the previous day will be prepared by the morning. According to the data control standards of the Turkish Revenue Administration (GİB), checks are performed to prevent the submission of incorrect data. If errors are found in the generated data, they can be identified before the files are sent to GİB, allowing for corrections at the source.

Reports can be previewed via a web interface.

Files are generated in Parquet format and automatically sent to SFTP servers.

This service is designed exclusively for organizations obligated to send data to BTRANS.
