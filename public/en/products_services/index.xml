      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;fraud-detection-for-digital-wallets&#34;&gt;Fraud detection for digital wallets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing a rule-based product that complies with MASAK (Financial Crimes Investigation Board) criteria to protect customer balances in digital wallets. Approaches emerging from discussions with various licensed electronic money institutions and our project work at Dijitalpark Technopark are reflected in the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our product is our own design and software, it is open to customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-it-ready-for-immediate-use&#34;&gt;Is it ready for immediate use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can contact us to test our Digital Wallet Fraud Detection product at an early stage and to use it when it&amp;rsquo;s finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-there-ai-support&#34;&gt;Is there AI support?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no machine learning or artificial intelligence support. However, these features are planned to be added in the upcoming period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-and-features&#34;&gt;Usage and features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messages to be sent to the fraud detection system during transactions are evaluated and responded to in real-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scenario management is provided through a web interface with unique methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions to be taken for detected transactions can be defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions are placed in a separate pool and evaluated by operators via the web by creating case files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction control flow and scenarios are open to dynamic updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fraud database is kept fully encrypted (encryption at rest). Compliance with regulations and privacy requirements can be ensured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web interface can provide authorization management, login with Active Directory (LDAP), and a maker-checker control structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;compatibility&#34;&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is suitable for container platforms. It can be operated in compliance with TCMB (Central Bank of Turkey), MASAK, and BDDK (Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency) regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-of-btrans-reporting&#34;&gt;Challenges of BTRANS reporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement to submit BTRANS reports daily has created a need for automating the reporting process. The routine for manually retrieving reports from the database or report services, uploading them to institutional servers, and verifying them is clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the BTRANS automation solution, the reports for the previous day will be prepared by the morning. According to the data control standards of the Turkish Revenue Administration (GİB), checks are performed to prevent the submission of incorrect data. If errors are found in the generated data, they can be identified before the files are sent to GİB, allowing for corrections at the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports can be previewed via a web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files are generated in Parquet format and automatically sent to SFTP servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This service is designed exclusively for organizations obligated to send data to BTRANS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-it-ready-to-use&#34;&gt;Is it ready to use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is ready to use. Installations are carried out on your company’s servers for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-there-a-web-interface&#34;&gt;Is there a web interface?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is a web interface. It features authority management, maker-checker workflow, and user login with Active Directory (LDAP). All user actions are logged for auditing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-in-touch&#34;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/h2&gt;
